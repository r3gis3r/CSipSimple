    <string name="warn_no_stun">STUN not enabled</string>
    <string name="warn_no_stun_description"> If you have no incoming sound while in call, it probably due to the fact you are under a NATed network and your SIP provider doesn\'t manage that.\n 
       	In order to workaround this case, it\'s sometimes useful to enable the STUN option.\n
       	If you have no incoming audio problem ignore this warning.\n
       	If you are in a country where public network is separated from other public networks, you may have to change the STUN server.\n
       	Use of STUN consume more battery.</string>

    <string name="warn_vpn_ics">VPN changes for 4.0</string>
    <string name="warn_vpn_ics_description"> You are running android 4.0 which doesn\'t notify about VPN status.\n
        A possible workaround is to check the route at regular interval.</string>

    <string name="warn_priv_int">Dialer integration</string>
    <string name="warn_priv_int_description">It appears that other applications installed on the phone tries to integrate to android too.\n
	    They do that a way that doesn\'t allow clever features like the one provided by us such as Filtering/Rewriting rules.\n\n
	    You have two choice : \n
	    Continue using our integration and install plugins to support other applications. (This will allow to apply filtering/rewriting rules on these applications too). \n
	    To do so, choose to always use mobile dialer instead of other applications using the checkbox when you\'ll make your next call.</string>
    <string name="warn_priv_int_description2">Second solution is to make the application integrate the same non clever way than other application.\n
	    This is an option supported by the application but discouraged because it\'s way less clever and provide a worse user experience.</string>
    <string name="warn_priv_int_register">Use non clever integration</string>
    <string name="warn_sdcard">Installation on SDCard</string>
    <string name="warn_sdcard_description">You have configured to be available for incoming call. But you have moved the application to SDCard.\nThis is discouraged, you should leave the application on internal storage.</string>
